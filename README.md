# Snake_game.py
Classic snake game that you can enjoy on your  console while you take a break from coding.
This code implements the use of lists and tuples as well as the curses and random modules. It is a fun python app to enjoy.
There are some improvements that can be made to this code.For example, the borders could be adjusted to allow the snake to go through one side and come out of the other. 
The snake also automatically dies when you press an arrow key pointing towards the direction of the tail. This can also be corrected in future versions of this code.
